# Natours

This is a project I did with a course from Udemy. 
In this project I made a responsive website with advanced css.

I purchased this course, because I'm interested in learning the newest technology.
Being able to write sustainable code with Sass and advanced Css is what I wanted to learn with this project.

####Step 1####
To start this project pull the repository and run:
npm install

####Step 2####
Run in the terminal npm run watch

####Open the website####
